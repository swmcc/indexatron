# 🤖 Indexatron: Experiment Results

> **Status:** ✅ SUCCESS
> **Date:** 2026-02-22
> **Hypothesis:** Local LLMs can analyze family photos with useful metadata extraction

## Executive Summary

The experiment was a success. Ollama running locally with LLaVA:7b and nomic-embed-text can:

1. **Analyze photos** - Extract descriptions, detect people/objects, estimate era
2. **Generate embeddings** - Create 768-dimensional vectors for similarity search
3. **Process batches** - Handle multiple images with progress tracking

All 3 test images were processed successfully with zero failures.

## Test Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Images Processed | 3/3 |
| Failed | 0 |
| Total Time | 40.82s |
| Avg Time/Image | ~13.6s |

### Sample Outputs

#### 🐕 family_photo_03.jpg
- **Description:** "A tan-colored Labrador Retriever is sitting on a wooden floor indoors"
- **Categories:** `["dog"]`
- **Mood:** calm
- **Processing Time:** 14.73s

#### 🍺 family_photo_02.jpg
- **Description:** "A photo of a bottle of beer and a glass with frothy white head on top, placed on a table at a restaurant"
- **Location:** Indoor restaurant
- **Objects Detected:** Beer bottle (Kingfisher brand), glass with beer
- **Categories:** `["beer", "restaurant"]`
- **Processing Time:** 14.2s

#### 👔 family_photo_01.jpg
- **Description:** "A man standing in an indoor conference room during a wedding reception"
- **Era Detected:** 2010s (medium confidence)
- **Person:** Male guest, 30s, wearing suit and tie
- **Categories:** `["wedding"]`
- **Processing Time:** 11.89s

## What Worked Well

### LLaVA Vision Analysis
- Correctly identified subjects (dog, beer, person)
- Detected specific brands (Kingfisher)
- Estimated era from visual cues
- Provided useful mood/atmosphere descriptions

### Embedding Generation
- 768-dimensional embeddings generated for all images
- Based on analysis descriptions (semantic meaning)
- Ready for similarity search when needed

### Batch Processing
- Progress bar with Rich library
- Skip existing functionality
- Combined JSON output

## Quirks & Learnings

### JSON Parsing Required Repair
LLaVA doesn't always output clean JSON. The analyzer needed:
- Code block stripping (`json ... `)
- Brace balancing
- Type coercion for nested objects

### Model Hallucinations
Some amusing observations:
- The dog photo mentioned "clothing" and "fashion trends for pets" (the dog had no clothes)
- Beer was classified under `people` array with `estimated_age: "Beer is an alcoholic beverage"`

These quirks don't break the system - robust parsing handles them.

### Processing Time
~13.6 seconds per image is acceptable for batch processing. Real-time analysis would need:
- Smaller model (llava:7b is the smallest)
- GPU acceleration
- Or async processing with user feedback

## Development Progress

Each milestone was developed incrementally:

| PR | Milestone | What It Proved |
|----|-----------|----------------|
| [#1](https://github.com/swmcc/indexatron/pull/1) | Ollama Connection | Local LLM runtime accessible |
| [#2](https://github.com/swmcc/indexatron/pull/2) | Image Analysis | LLaVA extracts useful metadata |
| [#3](https://github.com/swmcc/indexatron/pull/3) | Embeddings | 768-dim vectors for similarity |
| [#4](https://github.com/swmcc/indexatron/pull/4) | Batch Processing | Scalable to many images |

## Technical Stack

```
Ollama (local runtime)
├── llava:7b (~4.7GB) - Vision analysis
└── nomic-embed-text (~274MB) - Embeddings

Python 3.11+
├── ollama - API client
├── pydantic - Data validation
├── pillow - Image handling
└── rich - Console output
```

## Next Steps

This proves the concept works. Future integration:

1. **Rails API** - Add endpoint for on-demand analysis
2. **Database Storage** - Save embeddings in PostgreSQL (pgvector)
3. **Similarity Search** - Find "photos like this one"
4. **Face Recognition** - Cluster photos by person (future model)

## Conclusion

🤖 **The robots can see our photos.**

Local LLMs provide a privacy-preserving alternative to cloud APIs for photo analysis. The quality is good enough for family photo organization, and the 768-dimensional embeddings enable future similarity search features.
